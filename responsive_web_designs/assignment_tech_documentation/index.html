                    Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level
                    APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
                    It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data
                    processing, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph
                    processing, and Structured Streaming for incremental computation and stream processing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This tutorial provides a quick Introduction to using Spark. We will first introduce the API through
                    Spark’s interactive shell (in Scala).
                </p>

                    <li>
                        To follow along with this guide, first, download a packaged release of Spark from the Spark
                        website. Since we won’t be using HDFS, you can download a package for any version of Hadoop.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note that, before Spark 2.0, the main programming interface of Spark was the Resilient
                        Distributed Dataset (RDD). After Spark 2.0, RDDs are replaced by Dataset, which is
                        strongly-typed like an RDD, but with richer optimizations under the hood. The RDD interface is
                        still supported, and you can get a more detailed reference at the RDD programming guide.
                        However, we highly recommend you to switch to use Dataset, which has better performance than
                        RDD. See the SQL programming guide to get more information about Dataset.

                Spark’s shell provides a simple way to learn the API, as well as a powerful tool to analyze data
                interactively. It is available in either Scala (which runs on the Java VM and is thus a good way to use
                existing Java libraries) or Python. Start it by running the following in the Spark directory:
            </p>
            <p><code>./bin/spark-shell</code> </p>
            <p>
                Spark’s primary abstraction is a distributed collection of items called a Dataset. Datasets can be
                created from Hadoop InputFormats (such as HDFS files) or by transforming other Datasets. Let’s make a
                new Dataset from the text of the README file in the Spark source directory:
            </p>
            <p><code>scala> val textFile = spark.read.textFile("README.md")
            textFile: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[String] = [value: string]</code> </p>
            <p>You can get values from Dataset directly, by calling some actions, or transform the Dataset to get a new
                one. For more details, please read the <a
                    href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.html">API doc.</a>
            </p>
            <p><code>
            scala> textFile.count() // Number of items in this Dataset
res0: Long = 126 // May be different from yours as README.md will change over time, similar to other outputs

scala> textFile.first() // First item in this Dataset
res1: String = # Apache Spark
        </code></p>



            <p>
                Now let’s transform this Dataset into a new one. We call filter to return a new Dataset with a subset of
                the items in the file.
            </p>
            <p><code>scala> val linesWithSpark = textFile.filter(line => line.contains("Spark"))
            linesWithSpark: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[String] = [value: string]</code></p>
            <p>We can chain together transformations and actions:</p>

            <p><code>scala> textFile.filter(line => line.contains("Spark")).count() // How many lines contain "Spark"?
            res3: Long = 15</code></p>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="More_on_Dataset_Operations">
            <header>More on Dataset Operations</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Dataset actions and transformations can be used for more complex computations. Let’s say we want to
                    find the line with the most words:
                </p>
                <p><code>scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ").size).reduce((a, b) => if (a > b) a else b)
            res4: Int = 15</code></p>
                <p>This first maps a line to an integer value, creating a new Dataset. reduce is called on that Dataset
                    to find the largest word count. The arguments to map and reduce are Scala function literals
                    (closures), and can use any language feature or Scala/Java library. For example, we can easily call
                    functions declared elsewhere. We’ll use Math.max() function to make this code easier to understand:
                </p>
                <p><code>
            scala>scala> import java.lang.Math
            import java.lang.Math
            
            scala> textFile.map(line => line.split(" ").size).reduce((a, b) => Math.max(a, b))
            res5: Int = 15
          </code></p>
                <p>
                    One common data flow pattern is MapReduce, as popularized by Hadoop. Spark can implement MapReduce
                    flows easily:
                </p>
                <p><code>scala> val wordCounts = textFile.flatMap(line => line.split(" ")).groupByKey(identity).count()
            wordCounts: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[(String, Long)] = [value: string, count(1): bigint]</code></p>
                <p>
                    Here, we call flatMap to transform a Dataset of lines to a Dataset of words, and then combine
                    groupByKey and count to compute the per-word counts in the file as a Dataset of (String, Long)
                    pairs. To collect the word counts in our shell, we can call collect:
                </p>

                <code>scala> wordCounts.collect()
            res6: Array[(String, Int)] = Array((means,1), (under,2), (this,3), (Because,1), (Python,2), (agree,1), (cluster.,1), ...)</code>

                <p>
                    Spark also supports pulling data sets into a cluster-wide in-memory cache. This is very useful when
                    data is accessed repeatedly, such as when querying a small “hot” dataset or when running an
                    iterative algorithm like PageRank. As a simple example, let’s mark our linesWithSpark dataset to be
                    cached:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>scala> linesWithSpark.cache()
                res7: linesWithSpark.type = [value: string]
                
                scala> linesWithSpark.count()
                res8: Long = 15
                
                scala> linesWithSpark.count()
                res9: Long = 15
            </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may seem silly to use Spark to explore and cache a 100-line text file. The interesting part is
                    that these same functions can be used on very large data sets, even when they are striped across
                    tens or hundreds of nodes. You can also do this interactively by connecting bin/spark-shell to a
                    cluster, as described in the RDD programming guide.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Suppose we wish to write a self-contained application using the Spark API. We will walk through a
                    simple application in Scala (with sbt), Java (with Maven), and Python (pip).
                </p>

                <code>
            /* SimpleApp.scala */
            import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession
            
            object SimpleApp {
              def main(args: Array[String]) {
                val logFile = "YOUR_SPARK_HOME/README.md" // Should be some file on your system
                val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Simple Application").getOrCreate()
                val logData = spark.read.textFile(logFile).cache()
                val numAs = logData.filter(line => line.contains("a")).count()
                val numBs = logData.filter(line => line.contains("b")).count()
                println(s"Lines with a: $numAs, Lines with b: $numBs")
                spark.stop()
              }
            }

          </code>
                <p>
                    Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of
                    scala.App may not work correctly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This program just counts the number of lines containing ‘a’ and the number containing ‘b’ in the
                    Spark README. Note that you’ll need to replace YOUR_SPARK_HOME with the location where Spark is
                    installed. Unlike the earlier examples with the Spark shell, which initializes its own SparkSession,
                    we initialize a SparkSession as part of the program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We call SparkSession.builder to construct a SparkSession, then set the application name, and finally
                    call getOrCreate to get the SparkSession instance.
                </p>
                <p>Our application depends on the Spark API, so we’ll also include an sbt configuration file, build.sbt,
                    which explains that Spark is a dependency. This file also adds a repository that Spark depends on:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                name := "Simple Project"
                version := "1.0"
                scalaVersion := "2.12.17"
                libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "3.4.0"
            </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For sbt to work correctly, we’ll need to layout SimpleApp.scala and build.sbt according to the
                    typical directory structure. Once that is in place, we can create a JAR package containing the
                    application’s code, then use the spark-submit script to run our program.
                </p>
                <p><code>
            # Your directory layout should look like this
$ find .
.
./build.sbt
./src
./src/main
./src/main/scala
./src/main/scala/SimpleApp.scala
